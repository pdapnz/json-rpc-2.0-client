# JSON-RPC 2.0 Client

Copyright (c) Vladimir Dzhuvinov, 2010 - 2021

Provides a client-side class for dispatching requests and notifications to a 
JSON-RPC 2.0 server. The JSON-RPC 2.0 messages are sent by HTTP(S) POST.

Optional client session features:

* Customise the "Content-Type" header in HTTP POST requests.

* Set an "Origin" header in HTTP POST requests to simulate Cross-Origin 
  Resource Sharing (CORS) requests from a browser.
  
* Accept HTTP cookies (if client sessions are established by this mean instead 
  of through the JSON-RPC protocol itself).
  
* Customise the allowable "Content-Type" header values in HTTP POST responses.
 
* Set an HTTP proxy.

* Enable HTTP response compression using GZIP and DEFLATE content encoding.
  
* Preserve parse order of JSON object members in JSON-RPC 2.0 response results 
  (for human facing clients, e.g. the JSON-RPC 2.0 Shell).
  
* Ignore version 2.0 checks when parsing responses to allow client sessions to 
  older JSON-RPC (1.0) servers.

* Parse non-standard attributes appended in JSON-RPC 2.0 responses.

* ~Trust all X.509 server certificates (for HTTPS connections), including
  self-signed.~ (**Removed to avoid triggering X509TrustManager's security 
  vulnerabilities not compliant with Google Play Policies in Google Play Market.

Requirements:

* Java 1.6 or later

* The package depends on the JSON-RPC 2.0 Base library and the JSON Smart
  library for JSON encoding and decoding (fork of the popular JSON.simple
  toolkit, but with more efficient parsing).
